      "tag_description": "E1 CRM Entity → E41 Appellation\nThis property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. \n\nThis property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e., indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\n\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through *P140i was attributed by*, E15 Identifier Assignment, *P37 assigned* toE42 Identifier. \n\nIt is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through *P1 is identified by*, E41 Appellation, *P139 has alternative form* to E41 Appellation.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The capital of Italy (E53) *is identified by* “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)\n* Text 25014–32 (E33) *is identified by* “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)\n"

      "tag_description": "E1 CRM Entity → E55 Type\nThis property allows sub typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. \n\nThe CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.\n\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through *P41i was classified by,* E17 Type Assignment, *P42 assigned* toE55 Type.\n\n**Examples:**\n* “enquiries@cidoc-crm.org” (E41) *has type* e-mail address (E55).

      "tag_description": "E1 CRM Entity → E62 String\nThis property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CIDOC CRM constructs. \n\nIn particular, it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.\n\nLike property *P2 has type (is type of)*, this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The *P3.1 has type* property of *P3 has note* allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g., “construction”, “decoration” etc. \n\nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Coffee mug – OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) *has note* “chipped at edge of handle” (E62) *has type* Condition (E55).

The associated instance of E52 Time-Span is understood as the real time-span during which the phenomena making up the temporal entity instance were active. More than one instance of E2 Temporal Entity may share a common instance of E52 Time-Span only if they come into being and end being due to identical declarations or events.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The Yalta Conference (E7) *has time-span* Yalta Conference time-span (E52).

      "tag_description": "E3 Condition State → E3 Condition State\nThis property describes the decomposition of an instance of E3 Condition State into discrete, subsidiary states. \n\nIt is assumed that the sub-states into which the condition state is analysed form a logical whole - although the entire story may not be completely known – and that the sub-states are in fact constitutive of the general condition state. For example, a general condition state of “in ruins” may be decomposed into the individual stages of decay. \n\nThis property is transitive and non-reflexive.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The Condition State of the ruined Parthenon (E3) *consists of* the bombarded state after the explosion of a Venetian shell in 1687 (E3).

      "tag_description": "E4 Period → E53 Place\nThis property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. \n\nThe related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. *P7 took place at (witnessed)* does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\n\nThis property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through *P161 has spatial projection*, E53 Place, *P89 falls within* to E53 Place. E4 Period is a subclass of E92 Spacetime Volume. By the definition of *P161 has spatial projection* an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections, that is, instances of E53 Place. Something happening at a given place can also be considered to happen at a larger place containing the first. For example, the assault on the Bastille July 14th 1789 took place in the area covered by Paris in 1789 but also in the area covered by France in 1789. \n\n**Examples:**\n* The period “Révolution française” (E4) *took place at* the area covered by France in 1789 (E53).

The precise geographical location of the object during the period in question may be unknown or unimportant. \n\nFor example, the French and German armistice of 22 June 1940 was signed in the same railway carriage as the armistice of 11 November 1918.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (E7) *took place on or within* Westminster Abbey (E18).

The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e., instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.\n\nThe property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Napoleon (E21) *participated in* The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)\n* Maria (E21) *participated in* Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)\n"

For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Deckchair 42 (E19) *was present at* the sinking of the Titanic (E5).

An instance of E6 Destruction may be contiguous with an instance of E12 Production that brings into existence a derived object composed partly of matter from the destroyed object.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The Tay Bridge Disaster (E6) *destroyed* The Tay Bridge (E22).

It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.\n\nAnother example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.\n\n**Examples:**\n* The writing of the scope note of the CIDOC CRM property “P16 used specific object” contained in the CIDOC CRM version 4.1 (E7) *used specific object* Nicholas Crofts’ computer (E22) *mode of use* Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55).

For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. \n\nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled.

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (*P157 is at rest relative to)* relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \n\nThis property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through *P196 defines,* E92 Spacetime Volume, *P161 has spatial projection* to E53 Place. However, in contrast to *P156 occupies,* the property *P161 has spatial projection* does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \n\nIn contrast to *P156 occupies*, for the property *P53 has former or current location* the following holds: \n\nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \n\nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span. \n\nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through *P196 defines*, E92 Spacetime Volume, *P161 has spatial projection* to E53 Place. \n\n**Examples:**\n* The Saint Titus reliquary(E22) *occupies* the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53).

This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature.
